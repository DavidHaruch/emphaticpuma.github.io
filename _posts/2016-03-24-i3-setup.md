title: i3 window manager configuration
tags: linux i3
---

i3 or i3wm is a tiling window manager mainly targeted at Linux. Instead of
having all your windows "floating in space", i3 arranges windows into rectangles
that divide your screen.

*An example i3 setup[larger](/img/i3.png)*

To install, use your distro's package manager to install the packages `i3 i3lock
i3status`. `i3` may be called `i3wm` on some platforms.

Once you have installed i3, you will need to logout of your current desktop
environment. At your login screen (I believe the proper name is login manager)
on Gnome and KDE, there should be a dropdown or icon which will allow you to
select your desktop environment or window manager.  At this dropdown, select i3.

After this, you can continue to read this article or figure it out yourself.
Some great resources (in order of usefulness)

1. `man i3`
2. [i3 user's guide](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html)

## Essential Keybinds

`$mod` is either alt or windows(super), set to super with `set $mod Mod4`

key|action
|------------
`$mod+enter` | open a new terminal
`$mod+d` | open dmenu to pick a program
`$mod+Shift+q` | kill the focused window
`$mod+Shift+c` | reload config file
`$mod+Shift+r` | restart i3

## Configuration

The configuration file for i3 can be located in a number of places (other
locations are in the man page), I think the best location choice is at
`~/.i3/config`. To give yourself a base config to work from, copy the default
config into the new config.

    $ cp /etc/i3/config ~/.i3/config


These are the configuration options I think are most important, and are nowhere near what is possible with i3, but including everything possible to configure would take a huge article.


### Fonts & Icons
To set your font, use the `font pango` command. Include in this your icon font if you want one. I recommend [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) if you want icons.

    font pango:Ubuntu Mono, FontAwesome 10

To use fontawesome icons, go to the [cheatsheet page](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/cheatsheet) and copy/paste the icons you want into your editor.

### Function Keys

Especially if you are using a laptop, you need to use your function keys to change things like brightness and audio volume.

First, you need to install xbacklight, to control the backlight from the terminal.
Amixer is a cli interface to alsamixer, to control audio volume.

For printscreen/screenshot I use ksnapshot from KDE, your choice may be different so substitute your selected screenshot tool from the large number of [linux screenshot tools](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/taking_a_screenshot#Dedicated_software).

    sudo apt-get install xbacklight amixer
{% highlight bash%}

# volume/mute control
bindsym XF86AudioMute exec amixer -q -D pulse sset Master toggle
bindsym XF86AudioLowerVolume exec amixer -D pulse sset Master 5%-
bindsym XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec amixer -D pulse sset Master 5%+
# brightness control with xbacklight
bindsym XF86MonBrightnessDown exec xbacklight -dec 5
bindsym XF86MonBrightnessUp exec xbacklight -inc 5
# replace ksnapshot with your selected screenshot tool
bindsym Print exec ksnapshot

{% endhighlight %}

To find the keynames, use the `xev` command, then press the keys. You can also use keycodes with the command `keycode`.

### Background

Some people like a simple solid color background.

    exec --no-startup-id xsetroot -solid #444444

However, if you want an image, it is a little bit more complicated.

    sudo apt-get install feh
    exec_always feh --bg-scale ~/image.png

feh is a fast image viewer that can be used as a background setter. Change image.png to the location of your background file.

## Status Bar

i3's status bar comes from `i3status`, which has its own configuration.

i3blocks is an alternative status bar, [I wrote another post specifically about it]({% post_url 2016-03-26-i3blocks-setup %}).

## Lock Screen

You can use any screen lock program you want, but I find `i3lock` to be the best option (*it has i3 in the name!*). Another option would be [XScreenSaver](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XScreenSaver).

    sudo apt-get install i3lock

By default, it will give you a white screen, where you can type in your password and recieve visual feedback. You can give it an image to display with the `--image` flag. I bind mine to `$mod+b`. If you want to bind it to `$mod+l`, you will have to unbind the vi navigation option also in the config file.

**The image must be a png!**

    bindsym $mod+b exec "i3lock --image=image.png"

see `man i3lock` or <http://i3wm.org/i3lock/> for more options.
