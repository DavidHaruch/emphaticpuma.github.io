With claims like "Most accurate sensor on the market", and "Designed for the performance enthusiast", the logitech g303 has a lot to live up to.

## Features at a glance

## Hardware

The G303 uses a PMW3366 sensor, also used in the popular G502. It is an optical sensor with no smoothing, angle snapping, or built in acceleration. With a DPI range from 200 to 12000, there is a DPI setting for every person.

The sensor can be "surfaced tuned" to your own mousepad, or preset to logitech's own mousepads. In my experience, this really makes no difference, and does no harm or good, the mouse tracks just about perfectly on all surfaces I have used it on without the need for the tuning.

It uses mechanical switches which have a very responsive feel and are rated for 20 million clicks. They feature a "metal spring button tensioning system"; I have no idea how this works, but it gives the buttons a sharp and precise click--I rarely ever misclick compared to previous mice.
